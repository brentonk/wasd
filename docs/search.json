    "text": "“War made the state, and the state made war.”\n—Charles Tilly, 1975\nIn this course, we will examine how war has affected the development of major political and economic institutions. We will work through theoretical models of war’s role in state development, and we will use historical and statistical evidence to evaluate the explanatory power of these models.\nSome key challenges will arise repeatedly throughout the semester. How can we establish cause-and-effect relationships when we cannot run randomized experiments and must rely solely on historical evidence? And even if we establish that war shaped a specific institutional development in a specific state, how much can we generalize to other times and places? We will learn how to address questions like these.\n\nGeneral information\nPlace and time. We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:20–3:45 in Alumni Hall 201.\nContact. You can email me at brenton.kenkel@gmail.com. I try to respond to all student questions within one business day.\nOffice hours and meetings. My office hours are on Tuesdays from 2:00–3:30pm in Commons Center 326. You don’t need to make an appointment — just show up during my office hours. If you have a question but can’t meet during my office hours, email me first. From there we can decide if we can work out the issue over email or if we need to meet.\nTeaching assistant. The TA for War and State Development is Seungho Song. You can email him at seung.ho.song@vanderbilt.edu. His office hours are on Fridays from 3:00–4:30pm in Commons 317.\n\n\nGrading\nDaily reading quizzes (20%). Each class session will begin with a brief quiz about the content of that day’s readings. These quizzes are designed to ensure you have absorbed the main argument of the readings — no trivia or gotcha questions. Your four lowest quiz scores, including any quizzes that you miss, will be dropped before calculating your final grade.\nExams (15% midterm, 20% final). There will be an in-class midterm and final exam. Each exam will be evenly divided between short answer questions and a longer-format essay. Exams are open-notes, but you will need to print those notes — no electronic devices during exams. The final exam will be cumulative.\nResearch project (5% proposal, 15% first draft, 25% final draft). Outside of class, you will complete a research project that advances a theoretical argument about the effects of warfare on some aspect of state development, then uses historical evidence to test that argument. The theoretical argument may (and in fact should) draw on the course readings, but should also be a product of your own original thought. The empirical test should take one of the following forms:\n\nProcess tracing. Focus on a single historical case. Evaluate not only whether the theoretical predictions are borne out, but also whether there is direct evidence for the precise causal mechanisms underlying the theory.\nCase comparison. Focus on a small number (2–4) of historical cases that differ in the extent or nature of the state’s involvement in warfare. Evaluate whether the theoretical predictions are borne out, and whether the theory provides the best explanation of differences in developments across the cases.\nQuantitative data analysis. Follow the logic of the theory to yield a couple of hypotheses that can be tested at scale. Obtain systematic data on a larger number of historical cases, then perform statistical tests to evaluate the hypotheses. You can only choose this option if you have taken (or are taking) PSCI 2270, PSCI 2300, PSCI 2301, or a similar quantitative methods course providing the necessary background in data wrangling and statistical analysis.\n\nOn February 13, you will turn in a 2–3 page proposal for the research project. This proposal will outline the theoretical argument you intend to advance, the method of testing you intend to employ (including the selection of cases/data), and a list of sources you plan to consult in your research.\nOn March 20, you will turn in a complete first draft of the final research project. This draft will be graded along with detailed feedback, including specific suggestions for changes and additions to make in the final version.\nThe final draft, due April 17, should be roughly 15 pages, though there is no hard lower or upper bound. You will turn this in alongside a memo summarizing the changes you have made since the first draft, giving specific details on how you have incorporated or responded to the suggested changes. The paper itself will count for 20% of your course grade, and the accompanying memo will count for 5%.\nYou may use generative AI tools like ChatGPT however you please in conducting each stage of the research project. I suspect that if you try to just have AI write the entire paper for you, it will make things up and it will make weak arguments, and you will not do well on the assignment. We will spend some time talking in class about better and worse uses of generative AI when conducting social science research.\nExtra credit. There will be two opportunities for extra credit. One will involve your personal participation in a research study with the RIPS Lab. The other will involve collective participation in the end-of-semester course evaluations. I will tell you more about these at the appropriate times.\n\n\nSchedule\nAll readings will be available on Brightspace. For each reading, I’ll provide a reading guide with questions to help walk you through the reading and extract the most important information.\n\n\n\nTopic\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\nIntro to the course\nMon Jan 5\nNo readings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sovereign state\nWed Jan 7\nSpruyt (1994)\n\n\n\nMon Jan 12\nOlson (1993)\n\n\n\nWed Jan 14\nSánchez De La Sierra (2020)\n\n\n\nMon Jan 19\nNo class — MLK Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial control\nWed Jan 21\nTilly (1990), ch. 3\n\n\n\nMon Jan 26\nAbramson (2017)\n\n\n\nWed Jan 28\nThies (2005)\n\n\n\nMon Feb 2\nDincecco and Wang (2018)\n\n\n\nWed Feb 4\nHenn and Robinson (2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaising revenue\nMon Feb 9\nLevi (1988), ch. 2\n\n\n\nWed Feb 11\nKaraman and Pamuk (2013)\n\n\n\nFri Feb 13\nResearch proposal due\n\n\n\nMon Feb 16\nQueralt (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWed Feb 18\nCatch up/midterm review\n\n\n\nMon Feb 23\nMidterm exam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParliaments\nWed Feb 25\nKenkel and Paine (2023)\n\n\n\nMon Mar 2\nCox, Dincecco, and Onorato (2023)\n\n\n\nWed Mar 4\nBecker et al.

    "text": "Notes\nWe won’t be concerned with the particulars of new institutional history (abbreviated to NIH through most of the article) and historical sociology. Focus on the specific claims and evidence about the emergence, persistence, and extinction of different types of political organization in Europe.\n\nIn practice, this means you can skip over the subsections “The deductive perspective of new institutionalism” and “Some problems with new institutionalism” on pages 530–533.\nThe exception would be to read the paragraph that spans 531–532 if you need or want a refresher on free-riding and credible commitment.\n\nWhen Spruyt refers to “the end of the feudal era,” he’s talking about the early 1300s.\n\n\nQuestions\nWhat does Spruyt mean when he says that the principle of sovereignty is that “authority is territorial and exclusive”?\nSpruyt writes about four forms of political organization other than the sovereign state: feudalism, empire, city-leagues, and city-states. (He also mentions theocracy, but does not cover it in enough detail to answer the following question.) How does authority in each of these fail to be territorial and/or exclusive?\nHow does an empire handle trade? What are the benefits and costs of the imperial approach for a merchant or trader operating within the empire?\nWhat were the key differences between imperial and feudal approaches to trade? Why was feudalism poorly equipped to handle the increase in trade and the rise of the merchant/burgher class?\nSpruyt argues that standardization and hierarchy are key features of sovereign territorial states. How did these features help a state’s merchants engage in trade both within the state and outside its boundaries?\nHow did a city-league like the Hanseatic League differ from a sovereign state in terms of standardization and hierarchy? What were the costs and benefits for ordinary traders?\nHow did the lack of clear territorial boundaries make it relatively difficult for the Hanseatic League to manage diplomatic relations with other political units?\nHow were city-states similar to, and different from, sovereign states and city-leagues in terms of standardization and hierarchy? What were the consequences for the internal economy and external relations of city-states?\nSpruyt claims that military competition is not the main cause of why sovereign states outlasted competing forms of political organization. What evidence does he present to support this conclusion?"

    "text": "Notes\nOlson frequently makes references to historical figures or events that you may not be familiar with, like Imelda Marcos on page 569 or the Glorious Revolution on page 574. You don’t need to understand every single one of these references to get the gist of what Olson is arguing. But you’ll get more out of reading the article if, when you run into some unfamiliar proper noun, you head to Wikipedia or your favorite generative AI model to fill in the gaps.\n\n\nQuestions\nOlson predicts that there will be “little or no [economic] production in the absence of a peaceful order.” Why?\nHow are a “roving bandit” and a “stationary bandit” different, according to Olson? How are they similar?\nThe key question in Olson’s analysis is “Why should warlords, who were stationary bandits continuously stealing from a given group of victims, by preferred, by those victims, to roving bandits who soon departed?” What is the core of his answer to his question?\nIn what sense is a centralized, territorial state like a “stationary bandit”?\nHow does Olson’s account of the rise of early territorial states differ from a “social contract” theory, where governments are thought of as the outcome of a process of voluntary agreement among citizens?\nOlson claims that democracies will have better economic performance than dictatorships, even if democratic leaders are just as greedy and self-interested as dictators are. What’s the logic behind this claim?\nWhat is a “time horizon,” and how does it affect the way a stationary bandit will treat their subjects?\nOlson argues that autocratic rule will be bad for ordinary people in a country, at least compared to democracy, but that this alone is not a reason to assume the people will rise up to overthrow a dictatorship in favor of democracy. Why?\nImagine a situation where a dictator has been overthrown. What conditions, according to Olson, will lead to the establishment of democratic rule rather than a dictatorship by whoever overthrew the old dictator?"
