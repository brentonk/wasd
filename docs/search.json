    "text": "“War made the state, and the state made war.”\n—Charles Tilly, 1975\nIn this course, we will examine how war has affected the development of major political and economic institutions. We will work through theoretical models of war’s role in state development, and we will use historical and statistical evidence to evaluate the explanatory power of these models.\nSome key challenges will arise repeatedly throughout the semester. How can we establish cause-and-effect relationships when we cannot run randomized experiments and must rely solely on historical evidence? And even if we establish that war shaped a specific institutional development in a specific state, how much can we generalize to other times and places? We will learn how to address questions like these.\n\nGeneral information\nPlace and time. We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:20–3:45 in Alumni Hall 201.\nContact. You can email me at brenton.kenkel@gmail.com. I try to respond to all student questions within one business day.\nOffice hours and meetings. My office hours are on Tuesdays from 2:00–3:30pm in Commons Center 326. You don’t need to make an appointment — just show up during my office hours. If you have a question but can’t meet during my office hours, email me first. From there we can decide if we can work out the issue over email or if we need to meet.\nTeaching assistant. The TA for War and State Development is Seungho Song. You can email him at seung.ho.song@vanderbilt.edu. His office hours are on Fridays from 3:00–4:30pm in Commons 317.\n\n\nGrading\nDaily reading quizzes (20%). Each class session will begin with a brief quiz about the content of that day’s readings. These quizzes are designed to ensure you have absorbed the main argument of the readings — no trivia or gotcha questions. Your four lowest quiz scores, including any quizzes that you miss, will be dropped before calculating your final grade.\nExams (15% midterm, 20% final). There will be an in-class midterm and final exam. Each exam will be evenly divided between short answer questions and a longer-format essay. Exams are open-notes, but you will need to print those notes — no electronic devices during exams. The final exam will be cumulative.\nResearch project (5% proposal, 15% first draft, 25% final draft). Outside of class, you will complete a research project that advances a theoretical argument about the effects of warfare on some aspect of state development, then uses historical evidence to test that argument. The theoretical argument may (and in fact should) draw on the course readings, but should also be a product of your own original thought. The empirical test should take one of the following forms:\n\nProcess tracing. Focus on a single historical case. Evaluate not only whether the theoretical predictions are borne out, but also whether there is direct evidence for the precise causal mechanisms underlying the theory.\nCase comparison. Focus on a small number (2–4) of historical cases that differ in the extent or nature of the state’s involvement in warfare. Evaluate whether the theoretical predictions are borne out, and whether the theory provides the best explanation of differences in developments across the cases.\nQuantitative data analysis. Follow the logic of the theory to yield a couple of hypotheses that can be tested at scale. Obtain systematic data on a larger number of historical cases, then perform statistical tests to evaluate the hypotheses. You can only choose this option if you have taken (or are taking) PSCI 2270, PSCI 2300, PSCI 2301, or a similar quantitative methods course providing the necessary background in data wrangling and statistical analysis.\n\nOn February 13, you will turn in a 2–3 page proposal for the research project. This proposal will outline the theoretical argument you intend to advance, the method of testing you intend to employ (including the selection of cases/data), and a list of sources you plan to consult in your research.\nOn March 20, you will turn in a complete first draft of the final research project. This draft will be graded along with detailed feedback, including specific suggestions for changes and additions to make in the final version.\nThe final draft, due April 17, should be roughly 15 pages, though there is no hard lower or upper bound. You will turn this in alongside a memo summarizing the changes you have made since the first draft, giving specific details on how you have incorporated or responded to the suggested changes. The paper itself will count for 20% of your course grade, and the accompanying memo will count for 5%.\nYou may use generative AI tools like ChatGPT however you please in conducting each stage of the research project. I suspect that if you try to just have AI write the entire paper for you, it will make things up and it will make weak arguments, and you will not do well on the assignment. We will spend some time talking in class about better and worse uses of generative AI when conducting social science research.\nExtra credit. There will be two opportunities for extra credit. One will involve your personal participation in a research study with the RIPS Lab. The other will involve collective participation in the end-of-semester course evaluations. I will tell you more about these at the appropriate times.\n\n\nSchedule\nAll readings will be available on Brightspace. For each reading, I’ll provide a reading guide with questions to help walk you through the reading and extract the most important information.\n\n\n\nTopic\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\nIntro to the course\nMon Jan 5\nNo readings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sovereign state\nWed Jan 7\nSpruyt (1994)\n\n\n\nMon Jan 12\nOlson (1993)\n\n\n\nWed Jan 14\nSánchez De La Sierra (2020)\n\n\n\nMon Jan 19\nNo class — MLK Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial control\nWed Jan 21\nTilly (1990), ch. 3\n\n\n\nMon Jan 26\nAbramson (2017)\n\n\n\nWed Jan 28\nThies (2005)\n\n\n\nMon Feb 2\nDincecco and Wang (2018)\n\n\n\nWed Feb 4\nHenn and Robinson (2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaising revenue\nMon Feb 9\nLevi (1988), ch. 2\n\n\n\nWed Feb 11\nKaraman and Pamuk (2013)\n\n\n\nFri Feb 13\nResearch proposal due\n\n\n\nMon Feb 16\nQueralt (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWed Feb 18\nCatch up/midterm review\n\n\n\nMon Feb 23\nMidterm exam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParliaments\nWed Feb 25\nKenkel and Paine (2023)\n\n\n\nMon Mar 2\nCox, Dincecco, and Onorato (2023)\n\n\n\nWed Mar 4\nBecker et al.

    "text": "Notes\nWe won’t be concerned with the particulars of new institutional history (abbreviated to NIH through most of the article) and historical sociology. Focus on the specific claims and evidence about the emergence, persistence, and extinction of different types of political organization in Europe.\n\nIn practice, this means you can skip over the subsections “The deductive perspective of new institutionalism” and “Some problems with new institutionalism” on pages 530–533.\nThe exception would be to read the paragraph that spans 531–532 if you need or want a refresher on free-riding and credible commitment.\n\nWhen Spruyt refers to “the end of the feudal era,” he’s talking about the early 1300s.\n\n\nQuestions\nWhat does Spruyt mean when he says that the principle of sovereignty is that “authority is territorial and exclusive”?\nSpruyt writes about four forms of political organization other than the sovereign state: feudalism, empire, city-leagues, and city-states. (He also mentions theocracy, but does not cover it in enough detail to answer the following question.) How does authority in each of these fail to be territorial and/or exclusive?\nHow does an empire handle trade? What are the benefits and costs of the imperial approach for a merchant or trader operating within the empire?\nWhat were the key differences between imperial and feudal approaches to trade? Why was feudalism poorly equipped to handle the increase in trade and the rise of the merchant/burgher class?\nSpruyt argues that standardization and hierarchy are key features of sovereign territorial states. How did these features help a state’s merchants engage in trade both within the state and outside its boundaries?\nHow did a city-league like the Hanseatic League differ from a sovereign state in terms of standardization and hierarchy? What were the costs and benefits for ordinary traders?\nHow did the lack of clear territorial boundaries make it relatively difficult for the Hanseatic League to manage diplomatic relations with other political units?\nHow were city-states similar to, and different from, sovereign states and city-leagues in terms of standardization and hierarchy? What were the consequences for the internal economy and external relations of city-states?\nSpruyt claims that military competition is not the main cause of why sovereign states outlasted competing forms of political organization. What evidence does he present to support this conclusion?"

    "text": "Notes\nOlson frequently makes references to historical figures or events that you may not be familiar with, like Imelda Marcos on page 569 or the Glorious Revolution on page 574. You don’t need to understand every single one of these references to get the gist of what Olson is arguing. But you’ll get more out of reading the article if, when you run into some unfamiliar proper noun, you head to Wikipedia or your favorite generative AI model to fill in the gaps.\n\n\nQuestions\nOlson predicts that there will be “little or no [economic] production in the absence of a peaceful order.” Why?\nHow are a “roving bandit” and a “stationary bandit” different, according to Olson? How are they similar?\nThe key question in Olson’s analysis is “Why should warlords, who were stationary bandits continuously stealing from a given group of victims, by preferred, by those victims, to roving bandits who soon departed?” What is the core of his answer to his question?\nIn what sense is a centralized, territorial state like a “stationary bandit”?\nHow does Olson’s account of the rise of early territorial states differ from a “social contract” theory, where governments are thought of as the outcome of a process of voluntary agreement among citizens?\nOlson claims that democracies will have better economic performance than dictatorships, even if democratic leaders are just as greedy and self-interested as dictators are. What’s the logic behind this claim?\nWhat is a “time horizon,” and how does it affect the way a stationary bandit will treat their subjects?\nOlson argues that autocratic rule will be bad for ordinary people in a country, at least compared to democracy, but that this alone is not a reason to assume the people will rise up to overthrow a dictatorship in favor of democracy. Why?\nImagine a situation where a dictator has been overthrown. What conditions, according to Olson, will lead to the establishment of democratic rule rather than a dictatorship by whoever overthrew the old dictator?"

    "text": "Notes\nFrom page 48 onward, this article contains a lot of math that I don’t expect you to understand, especially if you haven’t taken econometrics. Keeping that in mind, here is how I would recommend approaching this article:\n\nRead pages 32–47 carefully. After summarizing the research question and findings (32–37), this will take you through the theory (37–40), the key questions/hypotheses (41–43), and an overview of the data that SdlS collected to test those hypotheses (43–47).\nGo back and reread the summary of the main statistical findings on pages 34–35. (“As a foundation for this study…” paragraph through “The third result is that…” paragraph.) This will give you the main need-to-know about the statistical analysis in the paper.\nFinally, give a quick skim to the full writeup of the statistical results on pages 48–70. Don’t overinvest in trying to understand everything here, and definitely don’t get bogged down in the mathematical parts. Just keep in mind the three main findings summarized on pages 34–35, and look for connections to the evidence that Sánchez de la Sierra presents here.\n\nRead the really long footnotes if and only if you are personally interested in their content. Almost by definition, a footnote cannot contain information that is critical to understand the central point of a paper. Many of the long footnotes here are just Sánchez de la Sierra explaining to his audience of economists — who aren’t typically trained in theories of state formation — the things you’ve already read in the Spruyt and Olson papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOptional: How to read Table 1\n\n\n\nIn case you’re interested in digging into the statistics a bit, but you haven’t taken econometrics or a similar course, here’s a brief guide to interpreting Table 1, which contains the paper’s core statistical findings.\nEach column in the table is a different dependent variable, measured across municipalities and years. The dependent variable in column (1) is whether the municipality was attacked by an armed group in a given year. Columns (2)–(6) give dependent variables measured for the mine(s) in a given municipality in a given year, and columns (7)–(9) give dependent variables measured for the support village.\nThe numbers in the first row, the one labeled \\(\\text{Coltan}_j \\times p_{ct}\\), are estimates of the effect of an increase in the price of coltan on the given dependent variable, specifically in municipalities with a coltan mine. A positive number represents a positive effect (increase) in the dependent variable, and a negative number represents a negative effect (decrease). An set of asterisks, or “stars,” appears by estimates that are statistically significant — loosely speaking, where the pattern in the data is strong enough that we can rule out the idea that it’s the sort of small variation that would arise in any random sample.\n\nFor example, the entry in column (1), for municipality attacks, is .15*** — a positive, statistically significant effect. This means that when the price of coltan increases, coltan-producing municipalities are more likely to be attacked.\nLooking across at columns (2)–(6), containing mine site dependent variables, you’ll see that every entry is positive, and most are statistically significant. This means that when the price of coltan increases, we see more indications of armed groups performing state-like functions at mining sites, including imposing customs taxes and providing security services.\nMeanwhile, in columns (7)–(9), containing support village dependent variables, the entries are all positive, but statistically insignificant. This means that the pattern in the data does reflect increased state-like behavior by armed groups in support villages for coltan-producing municipalities when the price of coltan increases, but not a strong enough pattern to separate this effect from the ordinary types of differences that would emerge in any sample of data.\n\nThe numbers in the second row, labeled \\(\\text{Gold}_j \\times p_{gt}\\), are interpreted similarly to the numbers in the previous row. The only difference is that these now represent estimated effects of an increase in the gold price on the corresponding dependent variable in gold-producing municipalities. The overall story this row tells is that increases in gold prices have no discernible effect on armed groups’ provision of state-like functions at mining sites in gold-producing municipalities, but they do have positive effects on the provision of state-like functions in support villages in those municipalities.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\nWhy has it historically been challenging to find data to evaluate the theory that the state emerged as a “stationary bandit”? According to Sánchez de la Sierra, why is the contemporary Democratic Republic of the Congo a setting where this theory can be studied? The economic difference between coltan and gold is important in this article. A key finding is that armed groups tax coltan-producing communities in the places where coltan itself is produced, whereas gold-producing communities are taxes in the places where earnings from gold production are spent. According to Sánchez de la Sierra, what is the important difference in coltan versus gold production that explains this difference in the location of taxes?\nSánchez de la Sierra finds that Congolese households tend to be better off when there is a local militia or army acting as a stationary bandit nearby, but not when an armed group from outside the country controls the local economy. How does this finding line up with Olson’s theory of roving versus stationary bandits?\nOn pages 37–38, Sánchez de la Sierra describes how the NDC-R armed group interacts with more than a hundred villages under its control. In what ways does this group meet — and fail to meet — Weber’s definition of the state as an organization with a monopoly over the legitimate use of force in a given territory?\nSánchez de la Sierra observes that in the rural eastern portion of the country, each municipality consists of a single “support village” associated with one or more mining sites. Why is this clear distinction between “mining sites” and “support villages” important for Sánchez de la Sierra to test his hypotheses about coltan versus gold as influences on the nature of governance by armed groups?\nAs you can see in Figure 3 (page 50), armed attacks on coltan-producing municipalities increased dramatically between 1999 and 2000, whereas attacks on gold-producing municipalities increased only slightly. According to Sánchez de la Sierra, what is the primary explanation for this difference in attack patterns?"
