## Approaching the readings

Some advice if you're struggling with the readings

- Don't try to absorb/memorize every detail from every page
- Two main things to extract from every reading
  1. What is the [central argument]{.alert} the author is making?
  2. What are the [main pieces of evidence]{.alert} they use to back it up?
- Look through the reading guide before starting the reading
- If you're still struggling through it
  - Email <brenton.kenkel@gmail.com> and/or <seung.ho.song@vanderbilt.edu> --- we're here to help!
  - Ask your favorite chatbot (see next slide)

## Getting AI help on readings  

Better than emailing us if --- and only if --- you want **instant** answers

Some tips based on my experience:

- Start a new chat for each different reading (avoid [context rot](https://jameshoward.us/2024/11/26/context-degradation-syndrome-when-large-language-models-lose-the-plot))
- Upload the PDF alongside your question
- Use the best models
  - Claude Opus 4.5 is best in class
  - ChatGPT 5.2 also very good, on <https://vanderbilt.ai> or ChatGPT Edu
- Ask directed questions
  - Worse: "What is this article about?"
  - Better: "What does he mean when he says sufficiently small groups can often organize for collective action?"


## Recap

Weber's **definition of the state**:

> A human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.  

Spruyt's findings on the **territorial state's rise** in Europe:

- Rise in trade $\leadsto$ feudalism not viable economically
- Various competitors arose: territorial states, city-states, city-leagues
- Territorial states won out due to economic + diplomatic advantages

## Today's agenda

The puzzle of **state formation** --- how does a territorial state come into existence in the first place?

1. Why the "social contract" theory is implausible
2. Olson's metaphor of the state as a stationary bandit
   - Transition from roving to stationary banditry
   - The surprising benefits of stationary bandit rule
3. Sánchez de la Sierra's evidence for Olson's theory


# Social contracts and the logic of collective action

## Social contract theory

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
::::: {style="font-size: 90%; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0.4em; border-radius: 5px;"}
"persons are primarily self-interested, and ... a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the maximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally ... and to consent to governmental authority."<br>
---[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/)
:::::

Government provides defense from bandits, warlords, predators --- necessary for any economy

All better off w/ government $\leadsto$ given the chance, we'd opt into having one

## Social contract theory: Justification ≠ explanation

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
![U.S. Declaration of Independence](declaration.jpg){fig-align="center"}
::::
:::: {.column}
The "social contract" is a device to **justify** a monopoly of violence, not explain its existence

Of course you and I never signed a contract!

Not only because our countries were born before we were --- it's just not how states came about

Olson goes further: large states **can't** be explained as result of a contract
::::

## Collective action and statehood

Key features of a collective action problem

- Success requires individual contributions
- If successful, the whole group benefits, even non-contributors

Examples: charity drives, protests, voting, overfishing/overhunting, carbon emissions reduction, arms races, many many many more

. . .

State formation as a collective action problem

- All in society benefit from defense + rule of law
- But there are individual costs to provide these
  - Paying taxes, or otherwise providing public services
  - Giving up own means of violence

## The group size paradox

Bigger group $\leadsto$ bigger total benefit from collective action

Yet large groups have a [harder]{.underline} time succeeding

- You and your roommates can probably keep stinky food out of your fridge
- But the world's governments haven't been able to stop global warming

. . .

The **free-rider** problem is severe in large groups

- Helping provide a public good is costly to me no matter what
- But the chance that my effort makes a difference is minuscule in a very large population

::: {.aside}
This famous argument was developed by Mancur Olson --- yes, the same Olson --- in his 1965 book *The Logic of Collective Action*.

## Solving the collective action problem

So how can we ever get collective action to work in large groups?

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column .fragment}
**1\.  Selective benefits**

![(Associated Press)](i_voted.webp){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Offer a "bonus" to contributors<br>
... or a punishment for free-riders

(costly + requires monitoring)
::::
:::: {.column .fragment}
**2\.  Via a hegemon/monopolist**

![(American Action Forum)](nato.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

One actor takes on the costs --- and reaps the biggest share of the benefits
::::
:::

## The puzzle of statehood

Governing a large state is very costly --- huge collective action problem

Unlikely to solve the problem via selective incentives

- Who has the resources to know who contributed, who didn't?
- Who has the power to effectively punish non-contributors?

. . .

But then who is going to step in and take on all the costs of establishing a state?

And once they do, what's to stop them from stealing everything from the subjects under their control?

. . .

Olson's answer: incentives are right for a **stationary bandit**
