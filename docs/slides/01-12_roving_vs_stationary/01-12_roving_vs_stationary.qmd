Some advice if you're struggling with the readings

- Don't try to absorb/memorize every detail from every page
- Two main things to extract from every reading
  1. What is the [central argument]{.alert} the author is making?
  2. What are the [main pieces of evidence]{.alert} they use to back it up?
- Look through the reading guide before starting the reading
- If you're still struggling through it
  - Email <brenton.kenkel@gmail.com> and/or <seung.ho.song@vanderbilt.edu> --- we're here to help!
  - Ask your favorite chatbot (see next slide)

## Getting AI help on readings  

Better than emailing us if --- and only if --- you want **instant** answers

Some tips based on my experience:

- Start a new chat for each different reading (avoid [context rot](https://jameshoward.us/2024/11/26/context-degradation-syndrome-when-large-language-models-lose-the-plot))
- Upload the PDF alongside your question
- Use the best models
  - Claude Opus 4.5 is best in class
  - ChatGPT 5.2 also very good, on <https://vanderbilt.ai> or ChatGPT Edu
- Ask directed questions
  - Worse: "What is this article about?"
  - Better: "What does he mean when he says sufficiently small groups can often organize for collective action?"


## Recap

Weber's **definition of the state**:

> A human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.  

Spruyt's findings on the **territorial state's rise** in Europe:

- Rise in trade $\leadsto$ feudalism not viable economically
- Various competitors arose: territorial states, city-states, city-leagues
- Territorial states won out due to economic + diplomatic advantages

## Today's agenda

The puzzle of **state formation** --- how does a territorial state come into existence in the first place?

1. Why the "social contract" theory is implausible
2. Olson's metaphor of the state as a stationary bandit
   - Transition from roving to stationary banditry
   - The surprising benefits of stationary bandit rule
3. Sánchez de la Sierra's evidence for Olson's theory


# Social contracts and the logic of collective action

## Social contract theory

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
::::: {style="font-size: 90%; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0.4em; border-radius: 5px;"}
"persons are primarily self-interested, and ... a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the maximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally ... and to consent to governmental authority."<br>
---[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/)
:::::

Government provides defense from bandits, warlords, predators --- necessary for any economy

All better off w/ government $\leadsto$ given the chance, we'd opt into having one
::::

## Social contract theory: Justification ≠ explanation

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
![U.S. Declaration of Independence](declaration.jpg){fig-align="center"}
::::
:::: {.column}
The "social contract" is a device to **justify** a monopoly of violence, not explain its existence

Of course you and I never signed a contract!

Not only because our countries were born before we were --- it's just not how states came about

Olson goes further: large states **can't** be explained as result of a contract
::::

## Collective action and statehood

Key features of a collective action problem

- Success requires individual contributions
- If successful, the whole group benefits, even non-contributors

Examples: charity drives, protests, voting, overfishing/overhunting, carbon emissions reduction, arms races, many many many more

. . .

State formation as a collective action problem

- All in society benefit from defense + rule of law
- But there are individual costs to provide these
  - Paying taxes, or otherwise providing public services
  - Giving up own means of violence

## The group size paradox

Bigger group $\leadsto$ bigger total benefit from collective action

Yet large groups have a [harder]{.underline} time succeeding

- You and your roommates can probably keep stinky food out of your fridge
- But the world's governments haven't been able to stop global warming

. . .

The **free-rider** problem is severe in large groups

- Helping provide a public good is costly to me no matter what
- But the chance that my effort makes a difference is minuscule in a very large population

::: {.aside}
This famous argument was developed by Mancur Olson --- yes, the same Olson --- in his 1965 book *The Logic of Collective Action*.
:::

## Solving the collective action problem

So how can we ever get collective action to work in large groups?

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column .fragment}
**1\.  Selective benefits**

![(Associated Press)](i_voted.webp){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Offer a "bonus" to contributors<br>
... or a punishment for free-riders

(costly + requires monitoring)
::::
:::: {.column .fragment}
**2\.  Via a hegemon/monopolist**

![(American Action Forum)](nato.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

One actor takes on the costs --- and reaps the biggest share of the benefits
::::
:::

## The puzzle of statehood

Governing a large state is very costly --- huge collective action problem

Unlikely to solve the problem via selective incentives

- Who has the resources to know who contributed, who didn't?
- Who has the power to effectively punish non-contributors?

. . .

But then who is going to step in and take on all the costs of establishing a state?

And once they do, what's to stop them from stealing everything from the subjects under their control?

. . .

Olson's answer: incentives are right for a **stationary bandit**


# A predatory theory of statehood

## States of anarchy

**Anarchy:** no centralized authority to provide security or enforce contracts

World of "self help" --- must provide own defense/enforcement

Examples

- Prehistorical humanity
- Caribbean pirate era, 1650--1730
- China's Warlord Era, 1916--1928
- Somalia, 1991--2012 (or longer)
- Eastern DRC, 1990s--present

## Roving bandits

An old question --- in a "state of nature" (anarchy), will we all be nice to each other, or all kill each other?

More realistic premise: [some]{.underline} people will predate upon others

. . .

Characteristics of the **roving bandit**

- Does not produce economically valuable goods
- Lives by stealing production from others
- "Invests" in means of theft: arms, horses, cronies
- Opportunistic --- finds a chance to steal the most value facing the least resistance, then moves on to a new target
- Essentially a parasite on the economy

## Roving banditry and economic incentives

A very simple model of the human economy

- People choose how much time/effort to spend laboring
- Labor produces output, which people divide between...
  - Consumption, including subsistence (bare minimum to stay alive)
  - Investment, raising future labor productivity
  - Defense, protecting consumption + investment from predation
- Goal is to maximize lifetime consumption, minus labor costs

. . .

**Discuss with your neighbors:**
What does the balance of labor look like in a world without bandits?
As the frequency and threat of banditry increases, how does this balance change?

## Roving banditry is even bad for the bandits

Little incentive for a roving bandit to limit their predation

- If you don't steal it today, someone else will tomorrow
- Only limiting factor is retaliation from the targets

. . .

$\leadsto$ little incentive to produce/invest above subsistence line

- Going to lose it all to a bandit eventually
- Surplus should go to defense, or just leisure

. . .

$\leadsto$ leaving relatively little for the roving bandits to take!

## From roving to stationary banditry

Olson's claim: expect a **stationary bandit** to emerge from anarchy

Key features of a stationary bandit

- Steals from the same set of people/territory repeatedly over time
- Monopolist: stops other bandits from stealing from these subjects

. . .

Central argument: this is better for both the bandit and the subjects

- Subjects get protection + better economic policy
- Bandits get more surplus than if they were roving
- This "system" becomes self-sustaining

## Roving versus stationary incentives

Unlike a roving bandit, a stationary one doesn't want to steal [everything]{.underline}

. . .

No surplus today $\leadsto$ no investment today $\leadsto$ less surplus tomorrow

(nerd voice) The bandit-optimal tax rate is less than 100%

. . .

Stationary bandit won't just limit theft --- it'll create conditions for investment

- Absorb the defense burden, protect against outside threats
- Provide some rule of law + internal policing
- In other words, the essential functions of **statehood**

. . .

Longer "time horizon" for the bandit $\leadsto$ more incentive to act like a state

# Evidence for Olson's theory

## Deriving hypotheses

If Olson's theory of stationary bandits emerging under anarchy is correct, what patterns should we expect to observe?

::: {.incremental}
1. Stationary bandits will establish where the potential gains are highest
   - High value of whatever is produced locally
   - Low defensibility against bandit theft
2. Longer time horizon among bandits $\leadsto$ better treatment of subjects
3. The economy does better under a forward-looking stationary bandit than under anarchy
:::

. . .

**Problem:** Very hard to measure these variables for the times when most present-day states were being formed!

## Context: Eastern DRC

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
To test theory, need data on somewhere with roving bandits --- state of anarchy

Sánchez de la Sierra's answer: Democratic Republic of Congo

No central control in east ---
numerous armed rebels

Production for global markets

- Coltan: bulky, hard to transport
- Gold: small, easily hidden
::::
:::: {.column}
![Eastern DRC in 2025 (BBC)](drc_2025.webp){fig-align="center"}
::::

## Hypothesis 1: Where do bandits settle down?

1. Stationary bandits will establish where the potential gains are highest: high value, low defensibility

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column .fragment}
![Coltan mining (Christian Science Monitor)](coltan.jpg){fig-align="center" height="250px"}

Bulky, costly to transport

Increase in price $\leadsto$ rebels tax [production sites]{.alert} where coltan is mined
::::
:::: {.column .fragment}
![Gold mining (PRI)](gold.webp){fig-align="center" height="250px"}

Easy to hide --- hard to tax production

Increase in price $\leadsto$ rebels tax [support village]{.alert} where earnings are consumed
::::
:::

## Hypothesis 2: How do bandits behave?  

2. Longer time horizon among bandits $\leadsto$ better treatment of subjects

. . .

How to measure time horizon?

| Provide security at mine       | [77%]{.cell-green}  | [62%]{.cell-red} | 69%                | [62%]{.cell-red} |
| Provide security to village    | 59%                 | [28%]{.cell-red} | [72%]{.cell-green} | 29%              |

## Hypothesis 3: Are regular people better off?

3. The economy does better under a forward-looking stationary bandit than under anarchy

<!--
Outline for this part:

- Deriving hypotheses from Olson:
  - Stationary bandits will establish themselves where they can steal stuff
  - Longer time horizon -> better treatment of population
  - Longer time horizon + stationary bandit -> population better off
- What we need to test those hypotheses
  - Condition of anarchy
  - Variation in lootability, time horizon, establishment of stationary bandit
- Why SldS looks to the Congo case + how he measures things
- Summary of findings

# Wrapping up

## The big picture

Olson's theory

- Collective action problem $\leadsto$ state won't emerge from voluntary action
- Instead, expect a criminal group to monopolize violence
- Long enough time horizon $\leadsto$ governance becomes less criminal

. . .

Sánchez de la Sierra's evidence

- Eastern DRC as closest approximation of anarchic environment
- Militias monopolize violence where there's high value they can easily extract
- Population treatment + welfare are best under state army / militias with local ties

## To do for next time
