## Recap

Previously in PSCI 2227 --- the basics of state development

- Spruyt 1994: sovereign territorial states won out --- but weren't inevitable

- Olson 1993: state development as evolution of criminal enterprise

- Sánchez de la Sierra 2020: evidence for Olson's theory from the DRC

## Today's agenda

Putting the **war** in "war and state development"

1. Crash course on theories of war

2. Tilly's account of war and state development in Europe
   - How war made states
   - Why this process was self-perpetuating
   - The role of commerce and capital


# Why wars happen

aka "PSCI 2221 in 30 minutes"

## Building a theory of war

War, for our purposes: **organized violence** in pursuit of **political aims**

. . .

Basic premises for a theory of war

- Rulers' interests may come into conflict
- They can resolve these conflicts through diplomacy (bargaining) or force
- They consider the costs and benefits of each approach
  - Implicitly ruling out emotional/psychological explanations
  - "Rationalist" approach --- widely, but not universally, used in the field

. . .

status quo enough out of line with military power $\leadsto$ dissatisfaction

dissatisfaction is **necessary** for conflict but not **sufficient**

## The insufficiency of dissatisfaction

Even when a state is dissatisfied, there are mutually acceptable agreements

Dissatisfaction $\leadsto$ status quo needs revision

- But that can happen through bargaining as well as war
- And bargaining gets there with fewer costs

The hurdle that any theory of conflict must clear:

   *Why don't they reach a bargain they both prefer over war?*

## Incomplete information

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
![Saddam Hussein (Getty Images)](hussein.webp){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
::::
:::: {.column}
Lots of secrets: strength, competence, willingness to fight

$\leadsto$ countries don't know each other's "breaking points"

$\leadsto$ potential bargaining failure

e.g., 2003 Iraq War

- U.S. didn't know Iraq didn't have nuclear weapons
- Iraq didn't know U.S. would invade if it thought Iraq was nuclear
::::

## Shifting power and commitment problems

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
One country rising, other declining

Declining state wants to "lock in" today's balance of power

Rising state can't commit not to renege on a deal made today

$\leadsto$ anything that would buy off the declining state, the rising state can't credibly promise to give

## Domestic politics

Baseline bargaining model assumes "the state" pays costs + receives benefits

But what if the public pays the cost and the leader gets the benefits?

- Old days: direct profit from crown lands
- Modern times: "rally round the flag" effect

Possible divergence between public interest + leader actions

... especially if ruler is **unrepresentative** and **unconstrained**


# War-making and state-building

## Tilly 1990, "How War Made States, and Vice Versa"

Tilly proposes a theory to explain **three patterns** in early modern Europe

. . .

1. Consolidation and growth of territorial states

. . .

2. Increased violence across borders, decreased violence within them

. . .

3. Rise of capital-intensive modes of production and violence

## Tilly's theory

"War made the state, and the state made war"

. . .

**Premises**

- Rulers want to stay in power + get rich along the way
- Rampant opportunity + willingness to use violence to gain territory
  - State of anarchy --- no one to stop the use of force

. . .

**Conclusions**

- Military competition forced rulers to extract immense resources to keep up
- Centralized, territorial states were best suited to survive --- and then to shake down their neighbors
- Wartime governance innovations persisted even when threats dissipated

## Key mechanisms in the theory

## The role of commerce and capital

Commercial states have major advantages in wartime

- Most important thing is to have the bigger army
- Even with conscription, can't arm + supply soldiers w/o money
- Almost impossible to ramp up budget quickly enough without borrowing
- Commercial economy $\leadsto$ banks, credit markets $\leadsto$ borrowing capacity

. . .

Compounding peacetime advantages

- Monetary economy --- can impose taxes instead of in-kind contributions
- Less distortion to the underlying economy --- keep the engine going

. . .

$\leadsto$ commercial states more successful --- and aggressive

<!--

  - Call back to Spruyt here in terms of increase in commercial value
  - Advantage during war: ability to borrow, access to credit
  - Compounding advantage in peacetime: more efficient allocation of resources since revenue could be raised through taxation instead of in-kind contribution
  - Combination of effects leads to more successful (and perhaps also more aggressive) commercial states
-->

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

1. Bargaining model of war
   - Necessary condition: military balance out of whack w/ status quo (dissatisfaction)
   - But then, why does bargaining fail?
     - Private information
     - Shifting power
     - Domestic politics/ruler incentives

2. Tilly's theory of European state development
   - War makes states --- develop or die out
   - Institutional developments persist into peace --- and increase the incentive for further war
   - Commercial/capitalist states advantaged in both ends of process

## Next time

Tilly tells a nice story --- does it stand up to statistical scrutiny?

- A skeptical take: Abramson, "The Economic Origins of the Territorial State"
- Reading guide to be posted by Friday

**Snowpocalypse contingencies:**

- If Vandy cancels, no class
- If Vandy's open but local public schools closed, Zoom class

Keep thinking about the final project!
