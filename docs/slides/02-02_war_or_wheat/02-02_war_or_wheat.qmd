## Recap

Way back before the ice storm, we talked about Tilly...

1. Bargaining model of war
   - Necessary condition: military balance out of whack w/ status quo
   - Why bargaining fails: private information, shifting power, domestic politics

2. Tilly's theory of European state development
   - War makes states --- develop or die out
   - Institutional developments persist into peace --- and increase the incentive for further war
   - Commercial/capitalist states advantaged in both ends of process

## Today's agenda

Two ways to evaluate the war-made-states thesis

1. The tempting-but-wrong way
   - Look at biggest consolidated states
   - See whether they fought a lot of wars

2. The systematic approach --- Abramson 2017
   - Collect systematic data on the European state system
   - Look for patterns consistent w/ Tilly thesis
     - Did states grow when war became more capital-intensive?
     - Were bigger states more likely to survive?
   - Competing hypothesis + evidence: urbanization drove the formation of --- mostly small --- states


# Selective versus systematic approaches

## War made the biggest states

A seemingly natural way to evaluate the Tilly thesis

- Look at the most successful consolidated territorial states
- Examine the role of war in their development

1439 --- Hundred Years' War --- permanent establishment of land tax

1790s --- French Revolutionary Wars --- raising of mass army, rights/representation expanded

1688 --- Glorious Revolution --- Dutch intervention establishes parliamentary supremacy

1701--1815 --- various wars, mostly against France --- development of sophisticated revenue system, high borrowing capacity

1640s--1680s --- tax-funded standing army established by the Great Elector

1740s--1780s --- major expansion of Prussian territory under wars by Frederick the Great

1806 --- war defeat led to major reforms in revenue raising, state bureaucracy, economy

1860s--1870s --- wars vs Denmark, Austria, France --- unification of German Empire

## Problems with this approach

We just [selected on the dependent variable]{.alert}

::: {.callout-note title="A metaphor"}
In a small town, ten people die in the span of a week.
The town doctor performs an autopsy on each of them, and finds that they all have the same chemical in their system.
Should you avoid contact with that chemical?

:::: {.fragment}
Would your answer change if I told you the chemical was H<sub>2</sub>O?

If we want to know what makes a "winner," also need to examine the "losers"

Abramson's approach: analyze patterns in **all** European states, even the ones barely anyone remembers nowadays

## Predictions if war made the state

Assume, momentarily, the classic argument is right

What patterns should we expect to see in a systematic study?

. . .

1. When war becomes more capital intensive, bigger states should prevail
   - 1400s--1600s: military revolution
   - artillery $\leadsto$ bastion forts $\leadsto$ protracted sieges
   - Forts and sieges both highly expensive

. . .

2. Larger states should be more likely to "survive" overall

## Urbanization and fragmentation: The correlation

![](table1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Urbanization and fragmentation: Causal argument

Problem: Urbanization doesn't happen randomly

- Can't rule out reverse causality, confounding variables

. . .

Pieces of the argument:

- Need to be able to grow cereals (e.g. wheat) to sustain cities
- Some places had a climate better suited to grow cereals
- Climate unlikely to affect fragmentation except through urbanization

. . .

Statistical finding: Higher fragmentation in cereal-suitable locales

. . .

Interpretation: Urbanization caused fragmentation
