# War and state development

## Three important patterns in Europe

In the second half of the last millenium...

1. Europe went from **hundreds** of (mostly) small states to about 30 big ones
2. The **capacity** of these states rose dramatically
    - They raise a lot more revenue
    - They provide many more services
    - Their governments are much more representative of all citizens
3. In the meantime, these states fought **many wars** against each other

## 1. Consolidation

## 3. War

Major wars in Europe, 1500--1900:

| War | Dates | Deaths | % of Pop. |

| Italian Wars | 1494–1559 | 300,000–400,000 | ~0.5% |
| French Wars of Religion | 1562–1598 | 2–4 million | 2.5–5% |
| Eighty Years' War | 1568–1648 | 600,000–700,000 | ~0.7% |
| Thirty Years' War | 1618–1648 | 4.5–8 million | 5–8% |
| War of the Spanish Succession | 1701–1714 | 400,000–1.2 million | 0.4–1.1% |
| War of the Austrian Succession | 1740–1748 | 400,000–500,000 | ~0.4% |
| Seven Years' War | 1756–1763 | 900,000–1.4 million | 0.6–1% |

## Questions we'll be asking

To what extent did all these wars [cause]{.underline} territorial consolidation?

. . .

And to what extent did they cause subsequent increases in...

- tax revenue?
- public representation?
- national identity?
- bureaucracy?

. . .

How special was Europe?
Do we also see these patterns in the Americas, Asia, and Africa?

## Methods of inquiry

**Theory.**
Can we construct [logically coherent]{.underline} explanations for why warfare would affect state consolidation and development?

. . .

**History.**
When we [look closely]{.underline} at how individual states developed, how much do the facts line up with the theoretical logic?
What events do the theories explain poorly?

. . .

**Statistics.**
Do the [broad patterns]{.underline} in data on state development match up with what our theories would predict?
Which patterns do the theories explain poorly?

## Exams

Midterm on February 23, final on April 23

Split between short answers and 1--2 longer essays (1 on midterm, 2 on final)

Open notes, but no electronic devices

Final is cumulative, but will mostly cover post-midterm content

## Research project: Overview

Central aims of the project

1. Make an argument about how war affects an aspect of state development
2. Use historical evidence to test that argument

Start thinking about potential topics **from day one**

Don't be shy to email me or drop by office hours to talk about topics!

No formal restrictions on ChatGPT/AI usage

- Probably not a good idea to have it write the whole thing for you
- We'll talk repeatedly in class about smarter/dumber uses of AI for research

## Research project: Specifics

1. Proposal due February 13 (5% of final grade)
   - 2--3 pages
   - Preview your argument, discuss historical cases you plan to study
   - List sources you plan to consult
2. First draft due March 20 (15%)
   - Complete draft of paper, 15ish pages
   - I will give you **detailed** feedback for final draft
3. Final draft and revision memo due April 17
   - Revision memo will detail changes since first draft
   - Paper itself is 20% of final grade, memo is 5%

## A final project and a final paper... wtf   

Why would I make you do this? Is it sheer pedagogical cruelty?

- Exams test the **breadth** of your knowledge of the course topics
- Final project will have you go in **depth** on a single topic you care about
- Both are important!

The requirements aren't as backloaded as you might fear

- The real "hard part" for the project is the first draft due March 20
- Feedback from there will give a clear path for the final paper

# Any more syllabus questions?

## Next time

**Topic:** The not-so-inevitable development of sovereign states

- What do we mean by the "state" in "state development"?
- What other forms of political organization could have prevailed instead?

**Reading:** Spruyt 1994, "Institutional Selection in International Relations"

- Reading quiz will be given for practice only (not graded)
- First graded reading quiz will be next Monday, January 12
