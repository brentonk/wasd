## Today's agenda

1. What is a sovereign state?
2. What [isn't]{.underline} a sovereign state?
3. Why did we end up with a world of sovereign states?


# Sovereign states

## We live in a world of sovereign states

## It wasn't always like this

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
Example --- the Duchy of Aquitaine

Part of France, but English king was the duke by heredity

English king's refusal to pay homage was a trigger for Hundred Years' War (1337--1453)

Before and during the war, unclear whose word was law

- Local lords took sides
- Brigands and bandits ran free

## Defining sovereign statehood

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column}
"A state is a human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory."<br>
---Max Weber, *Politics as a Vocation*

Key phrases here:

  - Monopoly
  - Legitimate
  - Given territory
::::
:::

## Double-checking the definition

![United States (via the BBC, ironically)](united_states.webp)

Does the United States successfully claim the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory?

## Governments that aren't sovereign states

Talk with the folks near you to come up with examples of governments past or present that:

1. Claim a monopoly of the legitimate use of force, but not in a given territory
2. Have a monopoly of force within a given territory, but it's not legitimate
3. Can legitimately use force within a given territory, but it's not a monopoly


# Alternatives to sovereign states

## Empires --- no limiting principle

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
![The Roman Empire over time (Wikimedia)](roman_empire.gif)
::::
:::: {.column}
They monopolize force

- At least at the core/center
- Periphery more contested

But no "given territory," and legitimacy is arguable
::::
:::

## Feudalism --- who's in charge?

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
Not the clear hierarchy you might have been told

Overlapping and cross-cutting contractual, legal, commercial, and religious obligations

Even a king wasn't truly in charge

- Relied on nobles for military support --- loyalty not assured
- Long-held rights and privileges hard to displace
- Also had to answer to the pope

## Spruyt 1994

:::: {.column}
Late medieval Europe (roughly 1300s)

Empire had mostly died out, and feudalism was unsustainable

- More value than ever in trade
- Yet no standard measures/money
- And no clear line of authority

Territorial states arose to meet these challenges --- **but so did other political organizations**

So why did the state prevail?
::::
:::

## Alternative 1: The city-league

![The Hanseatic League (Wikimedia)](hanseatic_league.jpg)

Agreement among cities for mutual trade and defense

Domestic politics/law still up to the individual city --- no central authority

## Problems with city-leagues

More standardization than under feudalism, but still incomplete

Cities could "opt out" of obligations when convenient (free riding)

- Defense ability not quite the sum of the parts
- Hard to negotiate agreements with other political organizations

Expanding membership posed threat to territorial states

## Alternative 2: The city-state

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
Mainly in northern Italy --- Venice, Florence, Genoa, etc

Delimited territory, dominated by the main city with many outlying towns

Not as centralized as a territorial state: smaller towns retained some autonomy

Advantage over city-leagues: clear center of authority, able to make agreements with outsiders

## Problems with city-states

Similar to problems with city-leagues, but less severe

Lesser towns often kept their own laws and standards

Resentment of major city $\leadsto$ lesser towns not reliable for military defense

Lasted longer than the Hanseatic League, but still mostly died out

- exceptions: Singapore, Monaco

## Why did the territorial state win out?

Spruyt focuses on a few key advantages

. . .

**Lower transaction costs.**

- Sovereigns could impose uniform money/measures to ease trade
- Outsiders knew exactly who they had to deal with

. . .

**More credible commitments.**

- Clear lines of authority $\leadsto$ ability to make long-run promises

. . .

**Less free-riding.**

- Nobles or cities that undermined the state would be sanctioned
- Aids both international cooperation and military defense

## What's left unexplained? (where does war come in?)

Why did states become so large?
Why do we have 200ish countries instead of 2,000 or 20,000?

- We'll see warfare has a lot to do with this!

. . .

Why did state revenues, capacities, and functions increase so much?

- Warfare has a lot to do with this too!

. . .

Why hasn't some other form of political organization emerged to displace territorial states?

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

**Define state sovereignty.**
Monopoly over the legitimate use of force in a given territory.

**See political alternatives to sovereign, territorial states.**

- Before territorial states emerged: empire, feudalism
- Contemporaneous: city-leagues, city-states

**Work through why territorial states prevailed.**
Advantages in trade, diplomacy, and defense.

## Next time

We'll start to think about states, conflict, and ordinary people

Key metaphor: the "stationary bandit"

**Reading:** Olson 1993, "Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development"

Reading quizzes will be graded starting next class!
