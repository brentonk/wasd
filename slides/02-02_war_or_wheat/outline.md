# European states: From war or wheat?

## The bellicist argument
- Recap the Tilly logic
- Scientific point to emphasize: the *precise* time that we saw state consolidation should line up with when war demands increased most
- Go through Military Revolution stuff

## Abramson's argument and evidence
- Selective vs systematic approaches
  - Selective: hey if you look at France this all seems right
  - Systematic: let's divvy up Europe into grid squares and come up with an obnoxiously precise definition of which political units are "states"
- Evidence against the bellicist explanation
  - State size --- measured appropriately --- doesn't trend with Military Revolution
  - Small states were disproportionately likely to *survive*, not die
    - Map the city belt
    - Burgundy example?
- Alternative explanation: urbanization as the key to statehood
  - Correlational evidence
  - In class exercise: Come up with confounding variables in the urbanization-fragmentation relationship
  - Instrumental variable analysis (briefly)
- So is Tilly disproved?
