## Recap

Warmaking and statemaking

- Tilly's theory
   - War makes states --- develop or die out
   - Institutional developments persist into peace --- and increase the incentive for further war
   - Commercial/capitalist states advantaged in both ends of process

- Abramson's skeptical take
   - States didn't grow when war became more capital-intensive
   - Smaller states were more likely to survive
   - Urbanization drove the formation of --- mostly small --- states

## Today's agenda

1. Latin America as a "hard case" for the theory
2. Thies' alternative: rivalry (threat of war) as driver of statebuilding
3. Reanalyzing the data on war, rivalry, and tax capacity


# Theory

## Generality of the war-and-statebuilding logic

Reminder of the basic logic

- Success in military competition requires troops and equipment
- Troops and equipment cost money --- a lot of money
- Large territorial states are best equipped to raise that money
- ... and can use these tools to consolidate power internally too

Theory came out of studying European history

...but when you boil it down to these parts, none of it is Europe-specific

## Problems for the Tilly story outside Europe

Why the theory is plausible for Europe

- Europeans fought lots of wars against each other
- Sovereign, territorial states emerged relatively early in Europe

But it's hard to see "war made the state" elsewhere

- Interstate war has been much less common outside Europe
- And yet sovereign territorial states came to dominate worldwide
- Maybe European colonialism can explain *emergence* of territorial states, but not as much *persistence* in post-colonial era

## Latin America as test case

Latin America is a "hard case" for the non-European application of the theory

Basic facts to contend with:

1. Vast majority of region gained independence 1800s--1830s

2. Major interstate wars have rarely occurred in the region

| War                        | Years      | Belligerents                           | Deaths            |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| War of the Triple Alliance | 1864--1870 | Paraguay vs Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay | ~300,000--400,000 |
| War of the Pacific         | 1879--1884 | Chile vs Bolivia, Peru                 | ~15,000--20,000   |
| Chaco War                  | 1932--1935 | Bolivia vs Paraguay                    | ~90,000--100,000  |

3. Borders have barely changed since independence movements

## Thies' theory: Rivalry made the state

Why is war important in Tilly's model?

1. Impetus to raise revenue and become more efficient at coercion
2. Prunes out political organizations that fall behind

. . .

The first of these should still operate under just the **threat** of war

. . .

Key concept for Thies: interstate **rivalry** as longstanding war threat

- "enduring" rivalry: 6+ low-level conflicts in 20-year period
- "strategic" rivalry: policymakers perceive rival as serious military threat

Unlike war, rivalry varies a lot over space + time in Latin America

## Not many wars in Latin America, 1900--2000

```{r war-network}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
# Get all Latin American countries from country_summary
latam_countries <- country_summary$country
nodes <- tibble(name = latam_countries)

# Parse dyads into from/to columns, filter to Latin American dyads only
edges <- dyad_summaries |>
  separate(dyad, into = c("from", "to"), sep = "-") |>
  filter(from %in% latam_countries, to %in% latam_countries) |>
  filter(war_years_cow > 0) |>
  select(from, to, weight = war_years_cow)

# Create graph
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = FALSE)

ggraph(graph, layout = "circle") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.7, color = "firebrick") +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 4) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(1, 5), name = "Years at War (COW)") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## But many strategic rivalries, 1900--2000

```{r rivalry-network}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
# Parse dyads into from/to columns, filter to Latin American dyads only
edges_rivalry <- dyad_summaries |>
  separate(dyad, into = c("from", "to"), sep = "-") |>
  filter(from %in% latam_countries, to %in% latam_countries) |>
  filter(rivalry_years_strategic > 0) |>
  select(from, to, weight = rivalry_years_strategic)

# Create graph
graph_rivalry <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges_rivalry, directed = FALSE)

ggraph(graph_rivalry, layout = "circle") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.7, color = "firebrick") +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 4) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(1, 5), name = "Years of Strategic Rivalry") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## (enduring rivalries are in between)

```{r enduring-rivalry-network}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
# Parse dyads into from/to columns, filter to Latin American dyads only
edges_enduring <- dyad_summaries |>
  separate(dyad, into = c("from", "to"), sep = "-") |>
  filter(from %in% latam_countries, to %in% latam_countries) |>
  filter(rivalry_years_enduring > 0) |>
  select(from, to, weight = rivalry_years_enduring)

# Create graph
graph_enduring <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges_enduring, directed = FALSE)

ggraph(graph_enduring, layout = "circle") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.7, color = "firebrick") +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 4) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(1, 5), name = "Years of Enduring Rivalry") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Thies' expectations

1. Sustained external rivalry spurs statebuilding
   - Provides impetus to raise revenue and become efficient
   - Expect gradual increase in state capacity rather than sudden bursts

. . .

2. Internal conflict hurts statebuilding
   - Undermines legitimacy of state
   - Saps resources that would be used to build capacity

. . .

3. Interstate war doesn't help or hurt
   - Key difference with medieval Europe: common access to debt finance
   - Less need to raise revenue domestically
   - (more on this in a couple weeks when we read Queralt)
   

# Data

## Measuring statebuilding

Thies collects annual data on South America, 1900--2000

- didn't do Central America because some sociologist didn't either 🤷🏻‍♂️

. . .

Dependent variable: **tax ratio**

- Annual tax revenue as a fraction of gross domestic product
  - e.g.: `tax_ratio` for Argentina 1975 = 0.112
  - means tax revenues were 11.2% of Argentina's economy
- Proxy for the state's extractive capacity (success as a stationary bandit)

. . .

Implicit assumption: how much the state *actually* raises is proportional to how much it *can* raise

## Redoing the data analysis here

Sorry to say, this article is basically a disasterclass in how to not do statistics

- No presentation of descriptive statistics, just complicated regressions
- "Bad controls": variables possibly affected by the treatment
  - Treatments = interstate war history, civil war history, rivalries
  - Bad controls = democracy, debt, GDP, inflation, trade, agriculture (i.e., everything but the time trend)
- Technical: poor measures of statistical error (no clustering by country)
- Makes lots of causal claims using exclusively correlational evidence

So I pulled the independent variables from the tables, reconstructed the tax ratio from [MOxLAD](https://moxlad.cienciassociales.edu.uy/), and redid the analysis how I like it

## Interstate war and tax ratio

```{r war-tax-scatter}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
ggplot(country_summary, aes(x = total_interstate_years_cow, y = avg_tax_ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 5, seed = 123) +
  labs(
    x = "Years in Interstate Wars (COW)",
    y = "Average Tax Ratio"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.3)) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

## Civil war and tax ratio

```{r civil-war-tax-scatter}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
ggplot(country_summary, aes(x = total_civil_years_cow, y = avg_tax_ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 5, seed = 123) +
  labs(
    x = "Years in Civil Wars (COW)",
    y = "Average Tax Ratio"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.3)) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

## Strategic rivalries and tax ratio

```{r rivalry-tax-scatter}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
rivalry_summary <- country_year |>
  summarize(
    avg_tax_ratio = mean(tax_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_strategic_rivalries = mean(rivalry_strategic, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = country
  )

ggplot(rivalry_summary, aes(x = avg_strategic_rivalries, y = avg_tax_ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 5, seed = 123) +
  labs(
    x = "Average Strategic Rivalries per Year",
    y = "Average Tax Ratio"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.3)) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

## Did rivalry make the state in Argentina and Chile?

```{r example-timeseries}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
example_countries <- country_year |>
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Chile"))

# Scale factor for secondary axis
scale_factor <- 0.3 / max(example_countries$rivalry_strategic, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(example_countries, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = rivalry_strategic * scale_factor), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = tax_ratio), linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Tax Ratio",
    limits = c(0, 0.3),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_factor, name = "Strategic Rivalries")
  ) +
  labs(x = "Year") +
  facet_wrap(~ country, ncol = 1) +
  theme_cowplot() +
  panel_border()
```

## What about the rest of Latin America?

```{r other-countries-timeseries}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
other_countries <- country_year |>
  filter(!country %in% c("Argentina", "Chile"))

# Global scale factor for secondary axis

ggplot(other_countries, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = rivalry_strategic * scale_factor), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = tax_ratio), linewidth = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Tax Ratio",
    limits = c(0, 0.3),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_factor, name = "Strategic Rivalries")
  ) +
  labs(x = "Year") +

## Tax ratio compared to regional average

    .by = year
  )

example_demeaned <- country_year_demeaned |>
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Chile"))

# Scale factor for secondary axis
scale_factor <- max(abs(example_demeaned$tax_ratio_demeaned), na.rm = TRUE) / max(example_demeaned$rivalry_strategic, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(example_demeaned, aes(x = year)) +

## Conclusions

Both types of war negatively correlated with tax ratios

Rivalry also negatively correlated with tax ratios

No correlation robustly distinguishable from statistical noise

"Eye test" doesn't suggest any particularly strong patterns either

. . .

**My conclusions:**

- Whatever variation exists in Latin American tax ratios, it's hard to trace to actual war [or]{.underline} preparations for wars that didn't happen
- Tilly is a much better guide to Europe (even if flawed) than to Latin America

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

- Examined whether Tilly's bellicist theory travels outside Europe
- Latin America: few interstate wars, stable borders, yet sovereign states persisted
- Thies' alternative: interstate *rivalry* (threat of war) spurs statebuilding
- Looked at the data: wars, rivalries, and tax ratios across South America 1900--2000
- Found little robust evidence that war or rivalry drove state capacity in the region

## Next time
